# The suri contract

This document states every behaviour suri promises to its callers. It changes
together with the code: a change in behaviour is a change to this document,
and a behaviour that is not written here is not promised.

## Promises

1. **A failed call is never reported as success.** If Alpaca rejects a
   request, or suri cannot tell whether it succeeded, the call returns an
   error.
2. **An order is never sent twice behind your back.** suri never retries an
   order or any other request that changes state. When it cannot tell whether
   such a request reached Alpaca, the error says so, and gives you what you
   need to find out.
3. **A stream message is never dropped without an error.** Every message
   suri receives reaches you or is reported as an error, and a stream that
   ends without your asking ends with an error saying later messages may be
   lost.
4. **Your credentials never appear in suri's logs, spans or errors.** Where a
   library suri depends on can log them at its most detailed levels, this
   document will name that library and the filter that removes them.

## How suri chooses

When the documentation leaves a choice open, suri chooses correctness first,
then performance, then simplicity, and leans towards the simpler option when
the last two pull against each other.
